# Instance Portals Advanced  
This AddOn displays Dungeon & Raid Instance Portals on the Continent Map.  
This is an Advanced Version of "Instance Portals" by StevenTroughtonSmith but with more Features and way more Accurate Dungeon & Raid Entrance Pins!  

The biggest Feature is to a Waypoint directly to the Instance Entrance by ***SHIFT + LeftClick*** an Instance Portal Pin on the Contnent Map or the Zone Map.  
This Feature supports TomTom and will fallback to the Original Blizzard Waypoint System if TomTom is not installed, so everyone can use it!  
You can also "force" to use the Original Blizzard Waypoint System by ***CTRL + SHIFT + LeftClick*** an Instance Portal Pin if you need it, but this only works for Continent Maps right now.
